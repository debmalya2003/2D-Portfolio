# Developer portfolio that's a 2D game

Inspired by the many creative 3D developer portfolios, I create one that's 2D instead.
This is meant as a template that you can use to build your own. It works on both desktop
and mobile.

Watch the tutorial I made on how to build this on YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwtfWORCN0U

I used a modified version of this original tileset (Giving credit where it's due) : https://momen-games.itch.io/happy-la-v2-ts
